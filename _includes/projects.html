			For the Scholars’ Lab Digital Humanities Fellowship, I'm using text analytic methods on the modernist poet Gertrude Stein. Chief among these methods is the use of grammar parsing algorithms that are able to tag parts of speech and grammar dependencies for sentences in Stein's text <i>How to Write</i>. I use the Python library SpaCy to tag and parse texts according to grammar level queries rather than N-grams or key words. This method allows me to look for patterns across Stein's notoriously complex experiments with grammar, combining traditional close reading with computational 'sifting'. You can see a small demo I built with Django <a href="http://grammar.click">here</a>, which provides quick visualizations of user-inputted sentences.

			My dissertation concerns the aesthetics of information, and the information of aesthetics, in 20th and 21st century literature. By examining literary texts centered on the relationship between language and information, I argue for the importance of modes of reading that can negotiate computational and instrumental uses of language--its transformation to and from ‘mere data’. Underlying these strategies is the contention that information should be as influential a term in literary aesthetics as it has been in the technologies of the last century, where it has expanded rapidly through mathematics, computer science, and even theoretical physics. Keeping pace with the rapid proliferation of information in technological discourse, I move through a wide range of cultural contexts, from the late Modernist style of Gertrude Stein, the constraint-based writing of the Oulipo, some key postmodern American novels, and finally to algorithmically generated writing. These diffuse texts are gathered together largely by their formal commitments rather than cultural context or ideological bent. I demonstrate how they exemplify literary forms that unite the technical discourse of information and code with the humanistic sense of the term as in<i>form</i>ing--developing and expanding the mind.

			<br>
			With support from the Scholars' Lab, I and five other graduate students in the arts and sciences designed and co-authored a visual essay about the Kardashian family and their expansive media footprint. The essay was featured in the journal <i>American Quarterly</i> and received a first place award at UVA's Huskey Research Symposium. You can visit the site <a href="http://dashamerikan.scholarslab.org/">here</a>.
